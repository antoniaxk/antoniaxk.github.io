					<h3>My Bio</h3>
					<p>Hello, my name is max, im a beagle and i turned 11 this summer! My family adopted me while I was still a puppy and since then, im having the best life. My family tells me im the most beautiful dog in the world. I love playing with my big sisters, but mostly I love when they pet me until I sleep. I also enjoy when they finish eating, my sister always has something left for me to eat! I hate when they torture me though...with someone called "the vet" and a thing called "bath"</p>
